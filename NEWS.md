# arealDB 0.3.6

* streamline translations to reduce the amount of items that have to be translated (specifically, only translate nations in normTable() that have been subsetted, not the whole list of nations)
* repeat translation of terms as long as some are still (accidently) missing.

# arealDB 0.3.5

* streamline overwriting of already registered items in the inventory tables.

# arealDB 0.3.4

* improved documentation due to this change.

# arealDB 0.3.3

* refine package documentation
* refine workflow to adapt some minor tweaks.

# arealDB 0.3.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
