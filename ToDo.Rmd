# high priority

- matchUnits need examples
- I still need to assert that the units are actually recorded; my idea would be that data should be recorded at the finest level at which they are reported so that aggregation only happens later, when the model is computed; which may not even be needed for some more advanced models in the future.

# medium priority

- check the documentation of all functions
- make sure that stage1 files are tested for UTF-8 encoding

# low priority

- nicht existierende commodities auf null setzen.
- I realised that the package also needs an option to join census and spatial data by an ID that may already be in the data, such as FIPS for the US census data.
